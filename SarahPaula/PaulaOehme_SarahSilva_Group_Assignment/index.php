		<h1>About Pokémon Club</h1>

			<p>Pokémon also known as Pocket Monsters in Japan, is a media franchise managed by The Pokémon 
			Company, a Japanese consortium between Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. The franchise 
			copyright is shared by all three companies, but Nintendo is the sole owner of the trademark. 
			The franchise was created by Satoshi Tajiri in 1995, and is centered on fictional creatures 
			called "Pokémon", which humans, known as Pokémon Trainers, catch and train to battle each other 
			for sport. The English slogan for the franchise is "Gotta Catch 'Em All". Works within the 
			franchise are set in the Pokémon universe.</p>
			<p>The franchise began as Pokémon Red and Green (later released outside of Japan as Pokémon Red 
			and Blue), a pair of video games for the original Game Boy that were developed by Game Freak and
			published by Nintendo in February 1996. Pokémon has since gone on to become the highest-grossing 
			media franchise of all time, with $90 billion in total franchise revenue. The original video game 
			series is the second best-selling video game franchise (behind Nintendo's Mario franchise) with 
			more than 300 million copies sold and 1 billion mobile downloads, and it spawned a hit anime 
			television series that has become the most successful video game adaptation with over 20 seasons 
			and 1,000 episodes in 124 countries. In addition, the Pokémon franchise includes the world's 
			top-selling toy brand, the top-selling trading card game with over 25.7 billion cards sold, an 
			anime film series, a live-action film, books, manga comics, music, and merchandise. The franchise 
			is also represented in other Nintendo media, such as the Super Smash Bros. series.</p>
			<p>In November 2005, 4Kids Entertainment, which had managed the non-game related licensing of 
			Pokémon, announced that it had agreed not to renew the Pokémon representation agreement. 
			The Pokémon Company International oversees all Pokémon licensing outside Asia. The franchise 
			celebrated its tenth anniversary in 2006. In 2016, The Pokémon Company celebrated Pokémon's 
			20th anniversary by airing an ad during Super Bowl 50 in January, issuing re-releases of 
			Pokémon Red and Blue and the 1998 Game Boy game Pokémon Yellow as downloads for the Nintendo 
			3DS in February, and redesigning the way the games are played. The mobile augmented reality game 
			Pokémon Go was released in July. The most recently released games in the main series, Pokémon: 
			Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!, were released worldwide on the Nintendo Switch on 
			November 16, 2018. The first live-action film in the franchise, Pokémon: Detective Pikachu, 
			based on Detective Pikachu, began production in January 2018 and is set to release in 2019. 
			The upcoming and latest games in the main series, Pokémon Sword and Shield, are scheduled to 
			be released worldwide on the Nintendo Switch in late 2019.</p>
